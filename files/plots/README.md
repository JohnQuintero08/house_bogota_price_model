area_vs_price.png

This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the total area of houses (in square meters) and their total price (in thousand millions of pesos). Each point represents a different house, color-coded by stratum, which likely indicates socioeconomic status or housing quality.
Here are some key observations:
**Price vs. Area**: There is a positive correlation between area and price, suggesting that larger houses tend to be more expensive.
**Stratum Differences**: Houses are divided into strata (1.0 to 6.0), with varying densities across the price and area spectrum. Higher-stratum houses may cluster at higher price points.
**Data Distribution**: While most points show a general upward trend, there are outliers and variability, especially in higher price ranges.This type of analysis can be useful for understanding market dynamics and making informed decisions in real estate.

The plot illustrates the importance of various features affecting house prices. Here's a breakdown of what the information conveys:
**Total Area**: This feature has the highest importance, indicating it significantly influences house prices.
**Stratum**: This also shows considerable importance but is less impactful than total area.
**Rooms and Bathrooms**: The number of rooms and bathrooms are notable factors as well.
**Age**: The age of the property is also a consideration but carries less weight than the previous features.
**Additional Features**: Other features listed seem to have minimal importance in this analysis, suggesting they are less relevant to price determination.
Overall, total area appears to be the most critical factor in evaluating house prices, followed by stratum, rooms, and bathrooms.

histogram_price_distribution.png
The plot you've shared is a combination of a histogram and a cumulative distribution function (CDF) for house prices. Here are some insights based on the general features of such a plot:
The histogram represents the distribution of house prices, with the x-axis showing the price of the houses (in millions of pesos) and the y-axis showing the percentage of houses in each price range.
The distribution likely has a right-skewed shape, indicating that while many houses are priced low, there are a few high-priced houses pulling the average up.
**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: - The red line represents the cumulative percentage of houses as the price increases.
**Interpretation**: The steepness of the CDF line can show how quickly prices rise in the market. A steep curve implies a rapid increase in cumulative percentage with a small increase in price. The histogram can help identify price ranges where most houses are concentrated, while the CDF offers insight into the total distribution of house prices.Overall, this analysis enables you to understand the pricing dynamics in the housing market depicted in the data.

pairplot_data_eda.png
The plots you've shared appear to be a pair plot (scatterplot matrix) that showcases the relationship between various features of houses and their prices.
**Price vs. Rooms** might show a correlation where more rooms generally lead to higher prices.
**Price vs. Total Area** can also indicate a positive relationship, as larger houses tend to cost more.
**Trends and Patterns**: You might notice trends indicating whether certain features contribute positively or negatively to house prices.
**Outliers**: Look for points that fall far away from the main cluster of data, which could indicate unusual property prices or features.
**Feature Relationships**: Some features might have strong correlations (e.g., total area and number of rooms) while others may have weak or no correlation.
